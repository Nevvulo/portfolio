          Poplet was a note-taking application with rich features such as
          real-time collaboration, permissions, automated actions when certain
          events take place and so much more.

        <ProjectContentText>
          My original motivation for developing a new note-taking application in
          such a saturated market was the fact that note taking in general is
          such a manual process: it'd be nice to have information automatically
          inferred where possible to speed up your workflow so ultimately you
          and your team members can spend more time doing what's important.

        <ProjectContentText>
          Although Poplet was eventually discontinued, it still served as a
          great learning experience for me and gave me lots of knowledge about
          how to deal with translations, dealing with a large-scale React
          project and security as I implemented a lot of core functionality
          (such as server-side validation, ratelimiting, scalability) on my own.
          It was the first project I developed on my own with the intention of
          being used by lots of people so I wanted to ensure I got things done
          properly.
