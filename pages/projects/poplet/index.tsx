            Poplet was a note-taking application with rich features such as
            real-time collaboration, permissions, automated actions when certain
            events take place and so much more.

          </ProjectContentHeader>
          <ProjectContentText>
            My original motivation for developing a new note-taking application
            in such a saturated market was the fact that note taking in general
            is such a manual process: it'd be nice to have information
            automatically inferred where possible to speed up your workflow so
            ultimately you and your team members can spend more time doing
            what's important.

          <ProjectContentText>
            Although Poplet was eventually discontinued, it still served as a
            great learning experience for me and gave me lots of knowledge about
            how to deal with translations, dealing with a large-scale React
            project and security as I implemented a lot of core functionality
            (such as server-side validation, ratelimiting, scalability) on my
            own. It was the first project I developed on my own with the
            intention of being used by lots of people so I wanted to ensure I
            got things done properly.
